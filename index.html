<i> The reason I took  Computer-supported cooperative work class is because I wanted to learn more about how computer systems are designed to support coordination and collaboration. Especially after covid-19, I wanted to see what new tools can be developed to support proper communication, co-ordination and sharing of information</i>

Colaborative softwares that i use regularly </b>
  <ul style="font-size: 20px;">
    <li> <b>Zoom</b> - I use it to colaborate with my teammates and class through video call.</li>
    <li> <b>Slack</b> - I use it to communicate with professors and TAs for a class where i am also a TA. Different channels makes discussion chat easier based on categories</li>
    <li> <b>Github</b> - Github has solved a major issue on working on team projects. I really like the feature of making your own branch in team projects to avoid conflicts</li>
    <li> <b>Airplay</b> - Airplay is an awesome feature for screen sharing on big screens. I have used it many times to watch movie on TV and also to teach in Labs.</li>
